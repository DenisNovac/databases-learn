# Isolation

* Can my in-process transaction see changes by other in-process transactions? Or my transaction took so long so someone made write of new data with their transaction.
  * it depends...
  * read phenomena - usually undesirable side effects of concurrent database usage

## Read phenomena

* dirty reads - read something that some other transaction didn't commit yet (chance that it will be rollback);
* non-repeatable reads - when you read the same value in the same transaction but the response is changed (e.g.: you read the value and then read SUM(_) - under the hood sum might read same value, so you might read 10 ids and count of ids might be 11) (row different);
* phantom reads - same as non-repeatable read but when two identical queries are executed (collection of rows different), mostly affect range queries;
* lost updates - when in transaction you trying to read what you just write but not committed but some other transaction changed what you wrote and your updates were lost.

### Dirty read example:

```sql
--tx1
SELECT PID, QNT*PRICE FROM SALES WHERE PID = 1
-- product 1 qnt = 10
-- pr1 price = 5
-- product 1 x10 = 50

--tx2
UPDATE SALES SET QNT = QNT+5 WHERE PID = 1
-- product 1 qnt = 15

--tx1
SELECT SUM(QNT * PRICE) FROM SALES WHERE PID = 1
-- should be still 50
-- but will be 75 because of dirt read from tx2 here

ROLLBACK TX2
COMMIT TX1 -- tx2 rollback but it affected tx1
```

### Non-repeatable read:

```sql
--tx1
SELECT PID, QNT*PRICE FROM SALES WHERE PID = 1
-- product 1 qnt = 10
-- pr1 price = 5
-- product 1 x10 = 50

--tx2
BEGIN TX2
UPDATE SALES SET QNT = QNT+5 WHERE PID = 1
COMMIT TX2
-- product 1 qnt = 15


SELECT SUM(QNT * PRICE) FROM SALES WHERE PID = 1
-- should be still 50 because at the time of read it was 50
-- will be 75 

COMMIT TX1
```

Postgres always makes new version of every row so those two problems never happen - transaction always read the same version of row (so rollback just goes to previous version). 

However, MySQL and Oracle (SQL Server?) - changes the  value directly (they keep undo table to rollback, keeping track of each change in transaction) so those problems might occur.

### Phantom read:

| pid | qnt | price |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 1   | 10  | 5     |
| 2   | 20  | 4     |


```sql

--tx1
SELECT PID, QNT*PRICE FROM SALES
-- pid1,2

-- it's not update, we've never read product 3 so it is not non-repeatable read
BEGIN tx2
INSERT INTO SALES VALUES (3, 10, 1)
COMMIT tx2

--tx1
SELECT SUM(QNT * PRICE) FROM SALES
-- will include product#3 = 140
```

### Lost updates

| pid | qnt | price |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 1   | 10  | 5     |
| 2   | 20  | 4     |


```sql
-- tx1
UPDATE SALES SET QNT = QNT+10
WHERE PID = 1
-- 10 + 10 = 20

-- tx2 STARTED AT THE SAME TIME
UPDATE SALES SET QNT = QNT+5
WHERE PID = 1
-- 10 + 5 = 15 -- we lost value
COMMIT tx2


SELECT SUM(QNT * PRICE) FROM SALES
-- 155, should be 180, but we lost 5 quantity of p1
```

Row-level locks solves that problem
