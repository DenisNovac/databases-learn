# Isolation levels for inflight transactions

Invented to fix read phenomena (each solves 1 problem + the all previous levels problems):


| Level            | Problem Solved                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Read uncommitted | ¯\_(ツ)_/¯                         |
| Read committed   | Dirty read                        |
| Repeatable read  | Non-repeatable read, Lost updates |
| Serializable     | Phantom read                      |


* Read uncommitted - no isolation, any change from outside visible to transaction (no database support except SQL Server???);
  * technically should be fast but no other benefits;
* Read committed - each query sees only committed changes by other transactions;
  * most popular level, default level for many databases;
  * most database engines optimized for that;
* Repeatable read - when query reads a row - that row will remain unchanged until transaction finished;
* Snapshot - each query in transaction only sees changes that have been committed before start of transaction. Like a snapshot version of the database at that moment;
  * no read phenomena happens;
* Serializable - transactions are run as if they serialized one after the other;
  * basically queue of transaction;
  * no concurrency in database.

Repeatable read "locks" the rows it reads and could be expensive on lot of rows (each is going to have lock). So Postgres just uses Snapshot here which is cheaper in such cases. They don't have separate implementation for those two levels.

Serializable vs Snapshot: snapshot works with versions of the databases and serializable completely removes concurrency - making everything slow.

## Implementation

Different in every database:

* pessimistic - row level locks, table locks (any change takes whole table - slow), page (about sharded tables) locks to avoid lost updates;
* optimistic - no locks, track if things changed and fail the transaction if something changed, user just need to retry;
  * serializable levels are usually done this way instead of locking;
  * no locks = no pending transactions;
  * no lock tracking = no management of locks (it's expensive);
  * NoSQL databases prefer this approach.
