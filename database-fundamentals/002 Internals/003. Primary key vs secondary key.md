# Primary key vs Secondary key

## Primary key

Primary Key, Primary Index does "clustering". Organizing the table around this key (Index-organizing table IOT). Entries will be sorted by this primary key (+additional cost on write). Heap is organized with that key - which means it is almost like an index, but inside of table organization on heap (without any additional entities aside from that table).

E.g. if you have entry with pk = 1 and = 8 then entry with pk=2 would move entire heap to be between them (db are optimized for that and make empty space for such cases between 1 and 8).

But SELECT is really cheap in that case.

GUID and other random things are actually bad for PK because it is random. 

## Secondary key

Secondary key is also called secondary index.

Outside structure (b-tree) instead of ordering the heap of table itself.

In Postgres all indices are secondary, it maintain internal row_id as primary index (???).
