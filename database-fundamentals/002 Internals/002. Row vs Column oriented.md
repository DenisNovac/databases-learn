# Row vs Column oriented databases

Row-Oriented:
* tables are stored as rows;
* single block to read - page with multiple rows with all columns;
* more IO required to find a particular row but once you find the row - you automatically get all it's columns because the whole row stored together;
* perfect for changing data;
* transactions are great.

Column-oriented:
* tables are stored as columns - single page contains the same one column of multiple rows;
* less IO to get more values of one column. But `SELECT *` is expensive;
* write and update are expensive (pages # = column # or MORE);
* perfect for aggregations and analytics.

e.g.:

```
1:1001, 2:1002...
```

```
-- lot of people has name John
John:1001;1006;1008, Kary:1002
```

All column value is actually `value:row_id`.

Indices is really similar to how column oriented databases works (see: inverted indexes).

Some databases allows to change engines for different table - you may use store one table with rows and other with columns.
